# Breast_Cancer_Analysis
Phase 3 Machine Learning Project

Introduction:

The aim of this project is to predict breast cancer survival using machine learning models with clinical and gene expression profiles. By using machine learning models on genetic data, we can improve our understanding of cancers and survival prediction.

The dataset used in this analysis is the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database, which is a Cananda-UK Project which contains targeted sequencing data of 1,980 primary breast cancer samples.
